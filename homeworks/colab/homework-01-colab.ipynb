    "## Homework 1: Introduction to Python and its Numerical Stack\n",
    "This homework is intended to assess your knowledge of core elements of the Python programming language and Numpy, a Python library for efficiently performing numerical computations as introduced during the in-class lectures and labs. In this assignment, you are asked to complete exercises that will assess your knowledge of Python data structures, Python control flow operators, Python functions, and numpy array manipulations. You may wish to refer to the course lectures and labs while completing this assignment. For complete information, you may reference the Python documentation [here](https://www.python.org/) and the Numpy documentation [here](hhttps://numpy.org/).\n"
