        "This homework is intended to assess your knowledge of clustering concepts and implementation using Python scipy and scikit-learn. As presented in class, scikit-learn is a Python library that provides many tools for machine learning model development and analysis. In addition to numerous foundational scientific computing methods, scipy also provides hierarchical clustring support. You may refer to the course lectures and labs while completing this assignment.
