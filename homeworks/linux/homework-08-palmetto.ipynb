Use your implementation of `support_for_unique_items` function to obtain the support (i.e., the counts) for each unique item in `records`. Divide the resulting support values by the number of records, `num_records`, to create a scaled value representing the fraction of records in which each unique item appers.

Recall, an item is considered frequent if it's scaled support is greater than or equal to the threshold. "
