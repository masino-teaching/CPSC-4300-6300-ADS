    "This homework is intended to assess your knowledge of linear regression concepts and implementation using Python statsmodels and scikit-learn. As presented in class, statsmodels is a Python library that provides many tools for developing and evaluating statistical models and scikit-learn is a Python library that provides many tools for machine learning model development and analysis.
